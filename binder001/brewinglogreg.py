# # Brewing Logistic Regression then Going Deeper
# 
# While Caffe is made for deep networks it can likewise represent "shallow" models like logistic regression for classification. We'll do simple logistic regression on synthetic data that we'll generate and save to HDF5 to feed vectors to Caffe. Once that model is done, we'll add layers to improve accuracy. That's what Caffe is about: define a model, experiment, and then deploy.
